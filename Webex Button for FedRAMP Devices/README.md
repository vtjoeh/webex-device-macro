Webex FedRAMP dial pad.  Used for devices registered to Webex FedRAMP.  
Purspose: By design, Webex FedRAMP devices cannot dial **meetingId**@webex.com .  By default the Webex button dials **meetingId**@webex.com. This makes the Webex Button useless.
This is a Webex Button replacement, therefore you will want to turn off the standard Webex Button.
